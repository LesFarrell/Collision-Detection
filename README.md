# Collision Detection
Various collision detection routines mostly based on Jeff Thompson's excellent routines found at http://jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php converted to C by me (Les Farrell) and using RayLib (https://www.raylib.com/) a light weight cross platform video game library to implement the graphics.
